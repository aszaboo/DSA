# Classes in C++

### What is the primary difference between a struct and a class?
Structs: Members of a struct are **public by default**
Classes: Members of a class are **private by default**

### When to use struct vs class

#### Structs
Used for passive data structures with public data members and no member functions

#### Classes
Used to define objects with both data members and member functions, encapsulating data and providing methods to operate on the data.
- Note: Classes generally also used when encapsulation, inheritance and or polymorphism used.

#### Inheritance
